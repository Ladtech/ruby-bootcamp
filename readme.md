## Getting Started

The course revolves around the [course dashboard](http://prezi.com/adnfktg98mli/?utm_campaign=share&utm_medium=copy&rc=ex0share) presentation. This is an interactive presentation that contains the material you will be learning, the exercises to help cement that learning and the suggested flow to go through.

This repository contains exercises to compliment the presentation flow, which you can work through at your own pace. Once you've completed the presentation and these exercises, you're done!


## What's in the Bootcamp?
### Dashboard
As mentinoed above, the [course dashboard](http://prezi.com/adnfktg98mli/?utm_campaign=share&utm_medium=copy&rc=ex0share) contains the overarching material for the course. It prescribes all of the things to read and do and the order to do them in. You should use the dashboard to guide you through the course.

### Exercises:
The exercises for the course can be found in the [exercises](./exercises) directory. The course [dashboard](#dashboard) will take you through the content and tell you which exercise to do when to complement what you are reading/watching.

### Workshops
There will be guided workshops, throughout the course. These will give you a deeper understanding of how the things you are learning glue together.

* [Logical statements](workshops/logical-statements/readme.md)
* [About blocks](workshops/about-blocks/readme.md)
* [Building a JSON API wrapper with `Net::HTTP`](workshops/json-api-wrapper/readme.md)
* [Sinatra Testing with `Rack::Test`](workshops/sinatra-rack-test/readme.md)
* [Domain Specific Language (DSL)](workshops/domain-specific-language/readme.md)


### Final Project
At the end of the course there is a larger project for you to get your teeth in to. This will require the sum of all of the things you have learnt. Fancy a peek? take a [look here](projects/twitter-user-interface/readme.md)



## Notes
- This course is still be actively developed so if something is not clear please check in with your trainers to find out what's next. Interested in what we are working on? [Take a look](https://huboard.com/Ladtech/ruby-bootcamp)
- This course assumes that you don't know Ruby but have are exerienced in another object oriented programming language, know TDD and at least one testing framework. Missing one of these things? Although it's not the core remit of the course to teach OO or TDD you will be doing lots of it and will have real opportunity to get stuck even more new things.
