# Cucumber


## Introduction

Cucumber is a tool that allows you to describe behaviour and write human-readable acceptance criteria.


## Objective

Write a set of cucumber tests that describe the behaviour of the hello_app.
Have a look at: [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/)

## Exercises

You can use bundler to install all the gems required by hello_app.
See: [Rails Tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org/book/beginning#sec-the_hello_application)

You will also need to install cucumber and add it to the app Gemfile.
See [Cucumber-Rails](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-rails)
