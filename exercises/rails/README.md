# Learning Rails

[Ruby on Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.org) is the most well known Ruby project.

Rails is used for several large applications at Sky, particularly when a customer facing UI is involved. It is less commonly used to provide pure API functionality.

To help you get on board with Rails at Sky, we have prepared a short presentation and a couple of exercises.

The aim here is to help you:

* Understand the Ruby on Rails framework - cli, convention over configuration, gems etc.
* Activerecord and databases
* See how Rails is used in Sky (with real examples)
* Be able to evaluate and take over an existing project
* Testing in Rails
* Explore the Rails ecosystem - hosting, monitoring, deployment, gems
* Evaluate when Rails might be an appropriate technology choice
* Encourage further exploration
* Write real rais code
