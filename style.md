# Style Guide


## Introduction

This guide aims to provide a structure and tone to which all exercises and workshops adhere to. By agreeing on a single approach, candidates will find materials easier to consume and complete.


## Structure


### Exercises

Exercises should consist of the following components:

* *Introduction* - A brief explanation of the exercise and it's expected outcomes
* *Tasks* - The content of the exercise. This may be more than one task, and should be completable in a linear fashion
* *Review* - A prompt for the candidate to review progress with a coach
* *Notes* - Any tips which may be useful to candidates (e.g. explaining something in more detail such as operator precedence), this should not give away the core answer to the exercise

Exercises should not enforce time limits, and allow candidates to work through things at their own pace. The review step is important to ensure they have fully understand the tasks before moving on.


### Workshops

Workshops should consist of the following components:

* *Introduction* - A brief explanation of the workshop and it's expected outcomes
* *Example usage* - The final code that should be produced at the end of the workshop
* *Walk-through* - A prompt for the workshop to be given (e.g. _Coding walk-through to be done in person with group_)
* *Solutions* - Links to solutions for the workshop, these may be used by the coach during the workshop
* *Extensions* - Any extensions candidates may take on following the workshop (e.g. expand on the code shown by adding X), this step is optional
* *Notes* - Any tips which may be useful to candidates (e.g. explaining why a certain approach has been taken over alternatives)

Workshops should be live coded where possible to show the working program being built piece by piece. Coaches should stop where appropriate to allow discussion and questions.


## Notes

* This style guide is not set in stone, the guild should craft it to however they wish to build the materials, but a unified approach is required to ensure the bootcamp feels consistent and clear to candidates
