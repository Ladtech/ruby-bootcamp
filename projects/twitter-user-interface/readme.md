# Twitter User Interface

## Introduction

The aim of this project is to provide a rough brief of expected functionality, without steering you too much in the direction of a particular solution. The end result should be a sum of all you've learnt during the bootcamp, and should make use of technologies you've picked up along the way.


## Brief

You should deliver a deployed Sinatra application which serves as an alternative user interface to the main Twitter website. It should implement the following techniques and functionality:

* Display a users home timeline
* Display a users mentions
* Display a users favourites
* Display a users direct messages
* Allows a user to search tweets
* Allow a user to post new tweets
* Add favouriting support to tweets
* Add retweet support to tweets


## Tools and Techniques

* Use of partial views
* Use of third party gems
* Using objects to model data
* Format dates in a human readable form
* Deploy the application to Heroku
