# Environment Setup


## Introduction

In order to hook yourself up for this course properly you are going to need to a couple of things.


## Setup your Environment.

You are going to need administrator access to your laptop to install the software that we are going to use. With the help of the group facilitator make the request.

After you have got administrator rights you are going to need to do a few bits and pieces:

* Create a Google account and send your username to `sky.training@lad-tech.com` from here we'll hook you up.
* Enable Google+ against your account. This will allow the Google hangouts addons that we use to function properly
* Install Google Chrome from the web, not Sky's self serve app store.
* Install the Google Hangouts addon: We'll use this to stay in touch with each other when we're not in the same room
* Install Slack, you will receive an invite for the training group shortly.
* Register for a floobits account. Floobits is a really great service that will allow us to write code together.
* Install VMWare fusion
* get a Github account (if you don't already have one)
* Get access to Safari Books Online
* Get access to Pluralsight
* Get access to codeschool


## Get the training VM up and running

Throughout this course we will be using a virtual machine that has all the software that you require on it.

**Note: ** the password for the VM is `password` :)


## Checkout the course exercises

* Fork the course exercises to your own area within Github.
* On the VM, under ~/Projects, clone your forked copy of the repository.
